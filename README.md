CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
efc10b902596        mongo               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   9 minutes ago       Up 9 minutes                27017/tcp           tender_grothendieck
```
----------------------------------------------------------

##### Start Contianer
If I want to run the mongo container then I need to get the container id, and run the start command which 
is shown below
```
> docker start efc10b902596
```
##### Stop Container
If I want to stop the mongo container then I need to get the container id, and run the stop command which 
is shown below
```
> docker stop efc10b902596
```
##### Interactive Mode
```
> docker exect -it <container_id>   -> docker exec -it efc10b902596 bash
```
Here *exec* is to execute, *-it* interactive mode. i.e to interact with container image
###### Result -> It will open the container in bash mode for interaction in our case we are interacting with mongo

we get such type of bash prompt
```
root@efc10b902596:/#
```
###### If we enter mongo in that, then will get below result
```
root@efc10b902596:/# mongo
```

Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

#### ----End O/P----

###### If we want to check dbs in mongodb then, in bash we need write add show dbs
```
> show dbs
admin   0.000GB
config  0.000GB
local   0.000GB
```

 #### If we want to exit from bash / Interactive mode of container
  ## ***_ctrl + d_*** ##														                         

 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#### Difference in docker stop and docker kill
```
> docker stop <container_id>
```
It will execute the ongoing process and then stop the container or we can say that after completion
of current executing work it can stop the container

```
> docker kill <container_id>
```
It will kill/stop the container without waiting for completion of ongoing process.

## !! DOCKER !!

You can install docker on Windows, Mac, Linux

Link for docker installation :- 
> [For Mac User](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

> [For Windows User](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

Before executing commands, make sure that you have login on Docker Hub.
> [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

#### Note : For Windows User
##### **If you have operating system with version -> Windows 10 Pro, then you can directly install docker desktop 
##### **If you don't have Windows 10 Pro, then you must install docker-toolbox to run docker on your machine

#### Commands

``` 
> docker version 
```
> To get the version of docker, which is installed in our system
--------------------------------------------------------
```
> docker pull <container_image>   e.g -> docker pull busybox
```
> It will pull *busybox* image from docker-hub
--------------------------------------------------------
```
> docker run <container_image>   e.g -> docker run busybox
```
> It will check whether it have busybox image in their local image repository, if it does not have this
> the it will go to docker-hub and pull that image to our local image repository and then run that, it 
> happens only once if the image is not their in our local image repository

> You can the different instances of busybox, by providing their version, If you didn't provide any 
> then by default it will take latest version

*for Default latest version, In both cases it will take latest version*
```
> docker run busybox:latest or >docker run busybox
```
*If you need to specify any particular version, **then??** *
```
> docker run busybox:12.0
```
> It will pull the busybox 12.0 version

---------------------------------------------------------
```
> docker ps
```
> To see running the container
----------------------------------------------------------
```
> docker ps --all or docker ps -a
```
> To see all the container
*E.g*
```
> docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES

```
----------------------------------------------------------
```
> docker start efc10b902596
```
> Start Container
> If I want to run the mongo container then I need to get the container id, and run the start command

```
> docker stop efc10b902596
```
> Stop Container
> If I want to stop the mongo container then I need to get the container id, and run the stop command

```
> docker rm efc10b902596.
```
> Remove Container
> If I want to completely remove the container , then run the remove command 

```
 > docker ps -all 
```
> To verify whether the image has removed or not, then we need to run above command and check in result whether image has gone or not.
---------------------------------------------------------------

> To check images on our host machine, then run
```
> docker images
```

> It will gives us below result for availabel images on host
```

> And to remove the image, from your host you need to run
```
> docker rmi <REPOSITORY_Name>
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Interactive Mode
```
> docker exect -it <container_id>   -> docker exec -it efc10b902596 bash
```
Here *exec* is to execute, *-it* interactive mode. i.e to interact with container image
###### Result -> It will open the container in bash mode for interaction in our case we are interacting with mongo

we get such type of bash prompt
```
root@efc10b902596:/#
```
###### If we enter mongo in that, then will get below result
```
root@efc10b902596:/# mongo
```

Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

###### If we want to check dbs in mongodb then, in bash we need write add show dbs
```
> show dbs
admin   0.000GB
config  0.000GB
local   0.000GB
```

 #### If we want to exit from bash / Interactive mode of container
  ## ***_ctrl + d_*** ##														                         

 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#### Difference in docker stop and docker kill
```
> docker stop <container_id>
```
> It will execute the ongoing process and then stop the container or we can say that after completion
> of current executing work it can stop the container

```
> docker kill <container_id>
```
> It will kill/stop the container without waiting for completion of ongoing process.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Multiple ways to get into container
```
docker exec -it  efc10b902596 bash - 
```
> In this  case we need to start the container first (if it is not yet running) and then need to execute this command to enter in that > > container
```
docker run -it mongo bash  
```
> You don't need to start container here, This command will start your container as well as it will enter in container as well

=== Create Your Own Image === 

> we can going to create mymongo image

> first create folder > mkdir mymongo
> Go to that folder > mymongo -> and then create Dockerfile

> Here understand that how to create container image

> Dockerfile -- It is processed by  --> Docker client --It will give futher to Docker Server and process the commands written in Docker > file --After all the processing image is going to generate--> Custom Image
 
> what to write inside the Dockerfile, hmmmm ??
> so, lets start, prior to that understand first how to write comment in Dockerfile
> using [ # ] symbol you can write the command.
> e.g --> # step 1


> Let's Start with create of Dockerfile
> Dockerfile is composition of:-
> [ INSTRUCTION ] [ ARGUMENT ] 
> Everything on left in dockerfile is instruction which tell docker client what to do
> Everything on right in dockerfile is argument which is instruction for that argument


<!-- Docker File Start -->

# step 1
# First step is used os to interact with hardware, here we are using alpine
# alpine - It is minimal docker image which is based on Alpine Linux 
# It is base image
```
FROM alpine
```

# step 2
# Install a software
# apk - It is like [ apt get ]
# binutils - is nothing but program
# It is like we are going to the alpine environment and adding binutils program
```
RUN apk add binutils
```
<!-- Docker File End -->

Each line in dockerfile contains layer, 

Now create docker image

Go to mymongo folder ```$mymongo >```
do the ls command to check Dockerfile is present or not ```$mymongo > ls```

then run docker build command, and see the result 
```$mymongo > docker build .```

If any of layer is failed, then we need to fixed it and it doesn't start with first layer, acutally it 
cache the layer and when we re-run it again, it takes from cache and starts from the failed part again
